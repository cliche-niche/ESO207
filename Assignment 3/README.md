## Assignment 3
<br>

### Description
This assignment's problem statement was based on graphs (adjacency list representation). We had to check if the given graph was bipartite or not in _O(|V| + |E|)_ time. If the given graph was bipartite, then a partition had to be assigned on the vertices.

The constraints on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) included limits on _V (1&lt;V&le;10<sup>5</sup>)_, _E (1&lt;E&le;10<sup>5</sup>)_, and that the given graph would be connected and undirected. But the analysis (and the submitted code) works for unconnected undirected graphs too.
