## ESO207 (2021-22 I Sem.)

This repository contains my submissions to ESO207A (2021-22 I Sem.) assignments in a team with [Akhil Agrawal](https://github.com/akhilagrawal1001). 

For each assignment, we had to write pseudo-code, its proof of correctness and complexity analysis of the algorithm written by us in a PDF file and submit it on [mooKIT](https://hello.iitk.ac.in/). We also had to submit code to the problem statements on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

Each assignment has a separate directory and a README describing it.

+ [<u>Assignment 1</u>](./Assignment%201)- This assignment was based on linear data structures, specifically linked lists.
+ [<u>Assignment 2.1</u>](./Assignment%202.1)- This assignment was based on a self balancing binary tree, specifically `2-3 trees`. This assignment did not include a Hackerrank component. All the three files (excluding [Problem Statement.pdf](./Assignment%202.1/Problem%20Statement.pdf)) were zipped and uploaded on [mooKIT](https://hello.iitk.ac.in/).
